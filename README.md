Certainly! Here's a concise introduction focusing on the founder, key principles, and objectives of HTML:

**Introduction to HTML:**

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, in the early 1990s. Berners-Lee developed HTML as a foundational technology for the World Wide Web (WWW), laying the groundwork for the exchange and sharing of information across the internet.

**Key Principles of HTML:**

1. **Simplicity:** HTML is designed to be simple and easy to understand, allowing developers to create web pages using straightforward markup tags.

2. **Universality:** HTML is a universal standard adopted by web browsers, ensuring compatibility and consistent rendering of web pages across different platforms and devices.

3. **Flexibility:** HTML provides flexibility in structuring and presenting content, allowing developers to adapt to various design requirements and user preferences.

**Principal Objectives of HTML:**

1. **Structured Content:** HTML's primary objective is to define the structure and layout of web content, organizing text, images, and multimedia elements into logical sections and elements.

2. **Interactivity:** HTML enables the creation of interactive web pages through the integration of hyperlinks, forms, and multimedia elements, enhancing user engagement and interaction.

3. **Accessibility:** HTML promotes accessibility by supporting semantic elements and attributes that improve the usability of web content for individuals with disabilities and assistive technologies.

4. **Compatibility:** HTML aims to ensure cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility, enabling web pages to be accessed and displayed consistently across a wide range of devices and browsers.

In summary, HTML, founded by Tim Berners-Lee, embodies principles of simplicity, universality, and flexibility. Its principal objectives include structuring content, fostering interactivity, promoting accessibility, and ensuring compatibility, making it a fundamental technology for building the modern web.
